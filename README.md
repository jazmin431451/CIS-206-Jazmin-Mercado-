## Assignment 1

Paragraph goes here ...
Assignment 1 was not difficult for me because I had already completed it. The only thing that perplexed me was determining what I needed to do, but the instructor clarified that for me. The code should be easy to comprehend. Because of the complex code, maintenance and debugging are difficult and expensive. To improve clarity and consistency, the sample series also makes use of coding style conventions. Because I am unfamiliar with the Hello World Program, I chose Python as a programming language. I also added some coding and am interested to see if it works. It is a motivation in the programming industry to create software programs easy to maintain.
