## Assignment 1
 Assignment 1 I was a little confused while working on the assignment, but my researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp assisted me greatly and demonstrated how to create the BMI. There is also another website where I use the basic categories chart and add little ticks instead of most of the decimal points. Also, calculate the assigned bmi: weight/(height * 2) * 703 It helps a lot in the wiki index of the body mass, and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source code that is given in the martial is like going on a treasure hunt to find the information. It took me a little while to understand more about Python 3, which is more different than other classes that I have taken before. 

## Assignment 2
The program in this Assignment 2 significantly increases on the BMI calculator that I created. BMI is only one method for calculating a person's weight and health. The program should collect the necessary variables from the user based on the calculation, such as the user's weight and weight level. Variables and constants are two historical and fundamental computer programming concepts. Most programming languages employ these concepts to manipulate data in an efficient and logical manner. Constants in most programming languages protect me from accidentally changing their values somewhere in the code when I code at two a.m., resulting in unexpected and difficult-to-debug errors. Constants also benefit in the readability and maintainability of my code. The program should easily identify and return.

## Assignment 3
I found it difficult to calculate the assignment 3 approach. I simply filled out the information requested in the formatting fields for height and weight. This is the right approach that needs to be taken for proper work: planning the formatting, doing the research, and watching videos. While I was doing it, I became aware of how some functions performed well while others did not. Python is not a straightforward programming language, so I'm picking up new skills. It is better to know now than to find out later in my career. discusses how to arrange attempts, returns, return value errors, and exits as well as how to handle arguments, returns, and return value errors. I'm making it more difficult than it already is.
