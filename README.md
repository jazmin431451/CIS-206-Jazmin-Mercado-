## Assignment 1
 Assignment 1 I was a little confused while working on the assignment, but my researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp assisted me greatly and demonstrated how to create the BMI. There is also another website where I use the basic categories chart and add little ticks instead of most of the decimal points. Also, calculate the assigned bmi: weight/(height * 2) * 703 It helps a lot in the wiki index of the body mass, and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source code that is given in the martial is like going on a treasure hunt to find the information. It took me a little while to understand more about Python 3, which is more different than other classes that I have taken before. 

## Assignment 2
The program in this Assignment 2 significantly increases on the BMI calculator that I created. BMI is only one method for calculating a person's weight and health. The program should collect the necessary variables from the user based on the calculation, such as the user's weight and weight level. Variables and constants are two historical and fundamental computer programming concepts. Most programming languages employ these concepts to manipulate data in an efficient and logical manner. Constants in most programming languages protect me from accidentally changing their values somewhere in the code when I code at two a.m., resulting in unexpected and difficult-to-debug errors. Constants also benefit in the readability and maintainability of my code. The program should easily identify and return.

## Assignment 3
I found it difficult to calculate the assignment 3 approach. I simply filled out the information requested in the formatting fields for height and weight. This is the right approach that needs to be taken for proper work: planning the formatting, doing the research, and watching videos. While I was doing it, I became aware of how some functions performed well while others did not. Python is not a straightforward programming language, so I'm picking up new skills. It is better to know now than to find out later in my career. discusses how to arrange attempts, returns, return value errors, and exits as well as how to handle arguments, returns, and return value errors. I'm making it more difficult than it already is.

## Assignment 4
This assignment taught me more about the for and while loops. For loops are extremely useful programming tools. However, when you're just getting started, they can be a little perplexing. How To iterate through each number in a specified range, for loops can be used in conjunction with Python's range() function. The while loop, like in Python, is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is met. When the condition is met, the line immediately following the loop in the program is executed. The while loop runs the block until a condition is met. When the condition is met, the statement is executed immediately following the loop. The else clause is only used when your while clause fails.

## Assignment 5
Assignment 5 is about testing the programming, and processing the BMI was challenging. So I should use every tool at my disposal to make it as simple as possible. Pytest is a fantastic tool for increasing testing productivity. However, I was having difficulty processing the four errors. I used some of the Wikiversity instructors' examples as well as other materials describing how to use pytest. So, while this Python test is still in its early stages, practicing will help me understand some of what I'm doing.The function (display results) was throwing an AssertionError, but I weren't printing it anywhere, so it appeared that test cases were failing. Now I can clearly see that all test cases pass with the appropriate error message.

## Assignment 6
The six assignments were interesting because I learned more about how to code the program and how to use the RLE format. RLE works by looping through the characters of a string and counting the number of times a character appears consecutively. If the character appears more than once, it is replaced by the character and the count of that character. For example, in the string "AAAABBBCCDD," the character "A" appears 4 times consecutively, so it is replaced with "A4". This process is repeated for the remaining characters in the string until the entire string is compressed. RLE is a simple and effective method of data compression. It can be used to reduce the size of a string, which is useful for efficient data storage and transmission. However, because it does not work well with non-repeating patterns, RLE is not suitable for compressing large amounts of data. Furthermore, RLE requires some overhead to store the count of each character, which can reduce data compression efficiency. Despite its shortcomings, RLE is an effective tool for compressing short strings.
