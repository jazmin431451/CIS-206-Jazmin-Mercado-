## Assignment 1

 Assignment 1 I was a little confused while working on the assignment, but my researcher at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp assisted me greatly and demonstrated how to create the BMI. There is also another website where I use the basic categories chart and add little ticks instead of most of the decimal points. Also, calculate the assigned bmi: weight/(height * 2) * 703 It helps a lot in the wiki index of the body mass, and learning how to break it down in an algorithm in the source code that is given in the martial is like going on a treasure hunt to find the information. It took me a little while to understand more about Python 3, which is more different than other classes that I have taken before.Â
